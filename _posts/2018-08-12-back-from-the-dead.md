It's been a while since I blogged. I've been out a while, but, hey, I'm back!

It hit me that after a couple of years, learning a lot along the way, it might be useful to some to share my experiences. Back in the day I was doing lots of PHP and Delphi, but I've moved on now.

Nowadays I'm more focused on [.NET Core](http://dot.net) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). At the same time, I came in contact with lot of other disciplines in the field of programming, like DevOps and architecture.

The idea of this blog is to share these experiences. I might even start streaming while doing so. So stay tuned for more exciting stuff!
